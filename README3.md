That is an excellent point of clarification. Thank you for flagging that.

It’s a crucial detail for toning the brand correctly. While the aesthetic is "cozy pastel," it shouldn't feel exclusionary.

Here is how that demographic insight refines our approach:
 * The Aesthetic Remains: The "Cozy/Lo-Fi/Pastel" vibe is actually perfect for this mixed demographic. In the desk setup and mechanical keyboard world, that aesthetic is hugely popular across genders because it's about comfort, creativity, and a chill atmosphere, rather than the hyper-aggressive "gamer fuel" aesthetic.
 * Visual Representation: Moving forward, when we use character avatars in graphics (like in the flowcharts), we will ensure:
   * Builders are represented predominantly with female or gender-neutral artistic avatars to reflect the core seller base.
   * Buyers are represented with a diverse mix of male and female avatars to reflect the broad appeal of the hobby.

It’s a subtle but important shift to make sure everyone in the Collective feels seen. Noting this for all future visual assets!
